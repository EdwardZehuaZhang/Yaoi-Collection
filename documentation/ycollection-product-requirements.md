# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Elevator Pitch
This AI-powered semantic search engine is designed to help manga readers find stories based on multi-dimensional tag combinations, instead of traditional single-tag searches. By using an advanced AI system to interpret tags such as character types, genres, and themes (e.g., "fire" and "water"), users can discover manga that closely matches specific scenarios or plot structures. This will provide more accurate and personalized search results, improving the manga discovery experience for users.

## Who is this app for
This product is for manga readers who want a more personalized and accurate manga search experience. It caters to both casual readers who want to discover new titles and avid readers who are looking for specific plot structures, character dynamics, and themes. It's especially beneficial for users who are tired of searching through tags that don't quite capture the nuances of what they're looking for in a manga.

## Functional Requirements
1. **Semantic Search Engine**: 
   - Users can enter multi-tag combinations (e.g., “fire” AND “water”) to refine search results.
   - The AI interprets complex tag combinations and matches the input to manga titles that contain the corresponding themes or scenarios.

2. **Metadata System**: 
   - Each manga entry has rich metadata describing its scenario, plot, character types, themes, and other significant elements. This metadata will be accessible to users both in search results and on individual manga pages.
   - Metadata will include tags like "adventure," "action," "romance," etc., as well as more specific ones like "fire," "water," and unique character dynamics.

3. **Search Functionality**: 
   - Search results will be presented in rows and columns of manga covers, with each result including a brief summary and metadata tags.
   - Users will be able to filter results by specific genres, characters, and themes.

4. **Home Page**:
   - Features a hero section with a large AI-powered search bar.
   - Below the search bar, sections such as “Popular Now” and “Newly Uploaded” display trending and newly added manga titles.

5. **Tag, Artist, Character, and Group Pages**:
   - Each of these pages will display metadata from A-Z, helping users explore the universe of tags and creators within the platform.
   - These will be simple pages where all relevant data is shown in an easily browsable format.

6. **Individual Manga Pages**:
   - Each manga page will display detailed metadata, including title, author, language, genre, and a list of associated tags.
   - The page will show the manga cover and a gallery of individual manga pages, allowing users to explore the manga's content further.

7. **Admin & CMS**:
   - A back-end CMS to manage metadata, tag updates, and new manga uploads.
   - Admins can update or add new manga, ensuring the database remains accurate and comprehensive.

8. **AI Tagging**:
   - As part of the search engine's function, the AI will also aid in generating tags based on user input and manga content to improve the search engine’s accuracy.

## MVP (Minimum Viable Product) Details
The MVP will include the following features:
- **Search Engine** with basic tag-based search functionality (using predefined tags like "fire," "water," "sky").
- **Home Page** with search bar and sections for “Popular Now” and “Newly Uploaded” mangas.
- **Search Results Page** where users can see their search query and results in rows of manga cover images with metadata tags.
- **Individual Manga Pages** with basic metadata and a series of images showing the manga's pages.
- **CMS Backend** for admins to add and manage manga entries and metadata.
- **Basic AI Matching**: A simple AI system for basic matching based on multiple tags.

Additional features such as AI-driven recommendations, advanced filtering, or complex search scenarios can be added in later iterations but are outside the scope of the MVP.
